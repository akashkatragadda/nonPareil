# nonPareil
The game is directed towards the audience who seekspuzzles, brain teasers as their interest. This game will be developed in Android Studio and use Java as its programming language. It is presented as a point and click style puzzle game, though often using other user interface, will have several levels.

As soon as user opens a new game on nonPareil, circular blocks are visible.A row consists of four circles,where User inputs the colour in each space by clicking on it, and aims to achieve the correct colour combination with the help of the result shown on the right side, as hint from the previous input. This result contains four smaller circles, which display colour combinations on each
attempt. The game allows a maximum of twelves attempts to crack the correct colour code. Seven colours have been used, namely Yellow , Red , Purple , Green , Light Blue , Brown and Grey (which represents blank or no colour). Two more additional colours, White and Black are used as indicators in result (as a hint) displayed on the right side after each submit. White colour indicates the equivalent number of correct colours guessed by the user, whereas Black colour reveals the correct position of the colour as well. Using the display of the hint view and the previous input, user progresses in nonPareil until maximum tries are exhausted or the user cracks the code, whichever comes first.
